## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Sass

### What I learned

I decided to do this project with Sass to practice, and I believe that it turned out ok. I don't know if it's because I don't have a lot of experience with Sass, but I think that it didn't really make a difference in how many lines I actually wrote. 

### Continued development

The active states shows a "Please check your email" under each input, and I didn't want to do it with a pseudoelement but with JS at a later date.
